You can compile libxayagame for Windows using cmake.

You may need to replace the file and folder paths in the various files and with those of your own environment. 

Precompiled binaries for Windows are available in the xayalib_unity respository [here](https://github.com/xaya/xayalib_unity). See [Downloads for developers](https://github.com/xaya/xaya_tutorials/wiki/Downloads) for more information.
